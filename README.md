I am a passionate dynamic developer who works on both frontend and backend. Here is an example of my portfolio website which showcases my skills and achievements .
This was first built in react and then later on transferred to a much compact yet reliable coding language such as html. 
This 401 lined code will surely surprise you once you run in the editor . 
Anyone who wants a fresh starter portfolio can continue /edit this current version to make themselves at ease. 
Looking forward for other intereseting projects as well!
Don't worry , I got you !
